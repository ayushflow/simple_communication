## [1.1.0] - 2024-07-28

### üöÄ Added
- **BroadcastChannel API Support**: Added modern BroadcastChannel API as the primary communication method for web-to-web communication
- **Message Queue System**: Implemented a queue-based localStorage system to handle multiple concurrent messages without overwrites
- **Automatic Memory Management**: Added automatic cleanup of old messages (5-minute TTL) to prevent localStorage bloat
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error handling with message corruption detection and cleanup
- **Retry Logic**: Added retry mechanism for acknowledgment system with configurable retry attempts
- **Graceful Degradation**: Automatic fallback from BroadcastChannel to localStorage for older browsers

### üêõ Fixed
- **Critical localStorage Key Bug**: Fixed the critical bug where apps were writing to one localStorage key (`simple_communication_bridge`) but reading from a different key (`communication_command`), which prevented web-to-web communication from working
- **Message Overwrite Issue**: Fixed issue where multiple messages could overwrite each other in localStorage
- **Memory Leaks**: Fixed potential memory leaks by implementing automatic cleanup of old and corrupted messages
- **Race Conditions**: Improved handling of concurrent message processing to prevent race conditions

### üîß Improved
- **Performance**: Significantly improved performance by using BroadcastChannel API instead of polling localStorage
- **Reliability**: Enhanced message delivery reliability with better acknowledgment system
- **Debugging**: Improved logging and error messages for better debugging experience
- **Browser Compatibility**: Better support for older browsers with automatic fallback mechanisms
- **Code Organization**: Better separation of concerns between different communication methods

### üìù Documentation
- **Updated README**: Added comprehensive documentation for new features and improvements
- **Usage Examples**: Added examples for BroadcastChannel and localStorage fallback scenarios
- **Troubleshooting**: Enhanced troubleshooting section with new common issues and solutions
- **Best Practices**: Added best practices for production use and error handling

### üîÑ Breaking Changes
- None - This release is fully backward compatible

### üß™ Testing

## Version History

- **1.1.0** (Current): Major improvements with BroadcastChannel API, message queue system, and critical bug fixes
- **1.0.0**: Initial release with basic cross-app communication functionality

## Migration Guide

### From 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

No migration required! Version 1.1.0 is fully backward compatible. The improvements are automatically applied:

- **Automatic BroadcastChannel Detection**: The package will automatically use BroadcastChannel if available
- **Automatic Fallback**: Older browsers will automatically fall back to the improved localStorage system
- **Enhanced Performance**: Better performance without any code changes required

### Recommended Updates

While not required, you can take advantage of new features:

```dart
// Enable logging to see which communication method is being used
SimpleCommunicationProvider(
  appId: 'my_app',
  enableLogging: true,
  child: MyApp(),
)
```
